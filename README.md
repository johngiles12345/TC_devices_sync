# TC_devices_config_sync
A python program for Transcanada that integrates MIB II device attributes found in their Solarwinds CSV export to the nGeniusONE device configuration to produce a specific Network Service name that contains the desired fields from both. Then that network service is placed into the dashboard hierarchy based on location names used to produce the Network Service name (label).
